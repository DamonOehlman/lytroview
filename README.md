# Lytro Viewer

Today I learned about [Lytro](https://www.lytro.com/).  Really Amazing Stuff, but they poor guys have only got a flash viewer for their files.  This is a little proof of concept creating a simple NodeJS server to decode the `.lfp` files and provide the JPEG image data for the rendered frames from the lightfield data.
